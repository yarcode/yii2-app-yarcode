Differences from yii2-app-advanced
----------------------------------
In contrast to the  [yii2-app-advanced](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced) this template out of the box has:
* [Support for .env file](docs/DOTENV-FILE.md)
* [API application](docs/API-APPLICATION.md)
* [Include yii2-tools-yarcode](https://github.com/yarcode/yii2-tools-yarcode)
* [Set of docker containers](#vrutalization)
* Integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* Pre-installed [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/) theme for the backend application

Requirements
------------
The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 7+.

Installation
------------
Install [composer](http://getcomposer.org]).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist yarcode/yii2-app-yarcode yarcode 
—Åd yarcode 
php init 
```

Copy .env file

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure `.env` and apply migrations. Make sure that you are properly configured to connect to the database.

``` 
php yii migrate 
``` 

The template installation is now complete.

Quality Control
---------------
### Travis CI 

To automatically build and test the application in a template, use [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/). The configuration is located in the file `.travis.yml` in the project's root directory. 

In the configuration file added [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer). 

### PHP Coding Standards Fixer

This tool allows us to automatically check the project code for compliance with standards and rules.

The configuration is in the file `.php_cs` in the project's root directory.

Execute the command to verify the code for compliance with the [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) standard 
``` 
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix -v --dry-run 
```

## Virtualization

This template supports [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) technology

### Base usage

Declare default environment variables in file
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Build your containers
```
docker-compose build
```
Create volume
```
docker volume create --name=yiidock_postgres_data
```
Init and apply migration:
```
cp docker-compose.override-example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
docker-compose run --rm workspace composer install
docker-compose run --rm workspace php init
docker-compose run --rm yii migrate
```
Start the containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Now app must be working:

* frontend app: [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
* backend app: [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)
* api app: [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003)

You can also start the services individually. 
Example, start only backend:
```
docker-compose up -d nginx-backend 
```
### Test environment
Tests are in the test catalogs `{application}/tests`.
They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/). By default there are 2 test suites for each applications(`api`, `frontend`, `backend`): 

- unit 
- functional 

For more information about testing Yii2 applications, [read here](http://codeception.com/docs/modules/Yii2) 

To run tests in a container can be used `docker-compose.test.yml` file.
Follow these three simple steps:
1. Create test volume:    ` docker volume create --name=test_postgres_data`
2. Apply migration for test database: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm yii_test migrate  `
3. Run all the tests that are in the template: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm codeception run `
    
It is possible to run only unit or only functional tests for the application, for example
``` 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm codeception run unit -c backend 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm codeception run functional -c api 
``` 
Also you can run some specific test by specifying the path to it
``` 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm codeception run functional -c api v1/ApiCest 
``` 
For debugging, it can be convenient to run tests with the flags `-f` and` --debug`
``` 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm codeception run functional -c api v1/ApiCest -f --debug 
```
